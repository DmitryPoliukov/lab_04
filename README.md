# EPAM Java Lam module_04
# Business requirements
1. Develop web service for Gift Certificates system with the entities Certificate, Tag
2. The system should expose REST APIs to perform the following operations:
    - CRUD operations for GiftCertificate. If new tags are passed during creation/modification â€“ they should be created in the DB. For update operation - update only fields, that pass in request, others should not be updated. Batch insert is out of scope.
    - CRD operations for Tag.
    - Get certificates with tags (all params are optional and can be used in conjunction):
          + by tag name (ONE tag)
          + search by part of name/description (can be implemented, using DB function call)
          + sort by date or by name ASC/DESC (extra task: implement ability to apply both sort type at the same time).
